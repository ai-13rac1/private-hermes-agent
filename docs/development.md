# Development and qualification

For operator setup, see [the README](../README.md). For network design and
execution boundaries, see [architecture and isolation](architecture.md).
Read [AGENTS.md](../AGENTS.md) before changing the stack and follow the
[planning workflow](planning-workflow.md) for substantial staged work.

## Repository layout and local configuration

- `components/`: tracked Dockerfiles, container scripts, and component defaults.
- `.env`: private operator settings, selected explicitly for each service.
- `config/`: private editable bind-mount configuration; initialized from defaults.
- `data/`: persistent bind directories for identities and executor work.
- `scripts/`: host-side initialization and checks.
- `tests/fixtures/`: disposable test servers and configuration.

`make init` creates missing local configuration files and leaves existing files
unchanged. Add new settings explicitly using `.env.example` as a reference.
`make build`, `make up`, and
`make x402_treazury-init` run it automatically. Image pins and source revisions live
in Compose and component Dockerfiles, not `.env`. Hermes and wallet state use native named volumes; other persistent files live
in `data/`. Runtime Tor socket IPC also uses a named volume. See
[configuration and backups](configuration.md) before starting.

## Qualification and maintenance

```sh
make check
make test
```

The live test uses a separate disposable Compose project with the actual pinned
Hermes image, the real SSH executor, real Tor, teep with a dummy provider
key, and the x402_treazury server with an unfunded fixture wallet. It performs no
inference or paid research calls. Stop a normal deployment before running it:
projects use the same fixed subnets, and preflight refuses overlaps.

Tests cover actual Hermes terminal and Python execution over SSH, absence of
agent keys/environment in the executor, Tor versus direct inference egress,
forbidden host/VM/RPC/private destinations, actual Streamable HTTP MCP
initialize/list/call with SSE responses, unselected ports, and Tor failure.
Tests use separate project volumes and private temporary bind directories, never
the operator's volumes or `data/` tree. Only disposable test resources are deleted.
